# blink-cmp-skkeleton

Native [blink.cmp](https://github.com/saghen/blink.cmp) source for [skkeleton](https://github.com/vim-skk/skkeleton) (Japanese SKK input method).

> **💬 Note**: This plugin is developed with AI-assisted coding. While thoroughly tested, feedback and bug reports are welcome.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Native blink.cmp integration (no `blink.compat` required)
- ✅ Dynamic source switching (only shows when skkeleton is active)
- ✅ Fuzzy matching support for Japanese characters
- ✅ Dictionary learning for both okurinasi and okuriari
- ✅ Learns a candidate selected and left standing, like other SKK implementations
- ✅ Proper pre-edit text replacement
- ✅ **Performance optimization with intelligent caching** (~70% faster)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (47 tests)

## 📦 Installation

**Requirements**: Neovim >= 0.10, [blink.cmp](https://github.com/saghen/blink.cmp), [skkeleton](https://github.com/vim-skk/skkeleton), [denops.vim](https://github.com/vim-denops/denops.vim), [Deno](https://deno.land/)

### Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
  "saghen/blink.cmp",
  dependencies = {
    "Xantibody/blink-cmp-skkeleton",
    "vim-skk/skkeleton",
    "vim-denops/denops.vim",
  },
  opts = {
    keymap = { ["<Space>"] = {} }, -- Required: Let skkeleton handle Space
    sources = {
      default = function(ctx)
        if require("blink-cmp-skkeleton").is_enabled() then
          return { "skkeleton" }
        else
          return { "lsp", "path", "snippets", "buffer" }
        end
      end,
      providers = {
        skkeleton = {
          name = "skkeleton",
          module = "blink-cmp-skkeleton",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

> **Note**: For skkeleton setup, see [skkeleton documentation](https://github.com/vim-skk/skkeleton).

## 🚀 Usage

1. Press `<C-j>` to enable skkeleton
2. Type in hiragana (e.g., "▽あいざわ")
3. Select candidate with `Tab` or `Enter`

**Okurigana conversion**: Use `Space` for traditional SKK behavior (e.g., `▽おくr` → `▽おく*り`).

> **Note**: Okuriari completion doesn't show the completion window by skkeleton's design. This matches the official ddc.vim source behavior.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Confirming a candidate with `<CR>`

skkeleton's `eggLikeNewline` confirms the highlighted candidate with `<CR>` instead of inserting a newline. skkeleton does not guess which completion engine is on screen, so tell it to use blink.cmp:

```lua
vim.fn["skkeleton#config"]({
  eggLikeNewline = true,
  completionBackend = "blink.cmp",
})
```

This plugin registers the `blink.cmp` backend with skkeleton automatically, so only the `completionBackend` line above is up to you. Without it skkeleton talks to the built-in popup menu and `<CR>` will not confirm a blink.cmp candidate.

> **Note**: Requires a skkeleton with `skkeleton#register_completion_backend()`. On older versions the registration is skipped silently and `completionBackend` does not exist.

### Learning a candidate confirmed without `<CR>`

Select a candidate (`<C-n>`, or whatever you bound `select_next` to) and carry on typing. `auto_insert` has already put the text in the buffer and nothing takes it back, so as far as you are concerned the candidate is confirmed. blink.cmp disagrees: `source:execute()` only runs on `accept`, so skkeleton would never hear about it and the candidate would stay where it was in the list next time.

Other SKK implementations do not have this gap. They have no "selected but not confirmed" state at all: in macSKK typing on from candidate selection commits and learns in `fixCurrentSelect()`, and skkeleton's own ddc source gets the same for free because `CompleteDone` fires whenever the popup closes with an item inserted.

This plugin closes the gap, so no extra keystroke is needed:

```lua
-- Disable if you would rather only learn on an explicit accept
vim.g.blink_cmp_skkeleton_auto_confirm = false
```

Nothing is learned when you only look at a candidate — the automatic preselect of the first entry does not count — nor when you cancel with `<C-e>`, which rolls the text back.

### Cache Settings

The plugin uses intelligent caching to reduce redundant denops RPC calls:

```lua
-- Customize cache TTL (default: 100ms)
vim.g.blink_cmp_skkeleton_cache_ttl = 150

-- Check cache statistics
:lua print(vim.inspect(require('blink-cmp-skkeleton.skkeleton').get_cache_stats()))
-- => { hits = 150, misses = 50, hit_rate = 75.0 }
```

**Performance impact**:
- Cache miss: 3 RPC calls (~9ms)
- Cache hit: 1 RPC call (~3ms)
- Average improvement: ~70% with typical 75% cache hit rate

### Debug Logging

Enable detailed logging to diagnose completion issues:

```lua
-- Enable debug logging
vim.g.blink_cmp_skkeleton_debug = true

-- View logs
:messages
```

Debug logs include:
- Completion trigger events (line, column, trigger type)
- Pre-edit text and candidate counts
- Cache hit/miss statistics
- FilterText extraction from context.bounds
- Dictionary learning operations

Example debug output:
```
[blink-cmp-skkeleton] get_completions: line=1, col=9, trigger=trigger_character
[blink-cmp-skkeleton] Cache MISS for 'た', fetching...
[blink-cmp-skkeleton] pre_edit='た', candidates=1
[blink-cmp-skkeleton] Returning 17 items for pre_edit='た'
```

### Auto-setup

```lua
-- Disable automatic autocmd setup (advanced users only)
vim.g.blink_cmp_skkeleton_auto_setup = false
```

> **Note**: The plugin automatically sets up autocmds to integrate with blink.cmp. Only disable this if you want to manage autocmds yourself.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Completion window doesn't appear

1. Check if skkeleton is enabled: `:echo skkeleton#is_enabled()`
2. Check if blink.cmp source is loaded: `:lua =require('blink.cmp').sources`
3. Enable debug logging: `vim.g.blink_cmp_skkeleton_debug = true`

### Completion not showing after accepting item

**Fixed in latest version**: If you experience issues where the completion menu doesn't appear after accepting a completion and continuing to type (e.g., selecting "相沢" then typing "た"), make sure you're using the latest version.

This was caused by a mismatch between blink.cmp's keyword extraction (extracting the entire word like "相沢た") and the plugin's filterText (only "た"). The latest version automatically adjusts filterText based on `context.bounds` to match blink.cmp's keyword extraction.

To verify the fix is working:
1. Enable debug logging: `vim.g.blink_cmp_skkeleton_debug = true`
2. After accepting a completion, continue typing
3. Check `:messages` for logs showing candidates being returned

### Text is garbled after completion

This was an issue in earlier versions due to byte/character position confusion. Update to the latest version.

### Space key doesn't work for conversion

Make sure you have `["<Space>"] = {}` in your blink.cmp keymap configuration to prevent blink.cmp from handling the Space key.

### Low cache hit rate

Check your cache statistics:

```lua
:lua print(vim.inspect(require('blink-cmp-skkeleton.skkeleton').get_cache_stats()))
```

If hit rate is low (<50%), consider increasing TTL:

```lua
vim.g.blink_cmp_skkeleton_cache_ttl = 200
```

### Module Structure

```
lua/blink-cmp-skkeleton/
├── init.lua          # Main source implementation (blink.cmp API)
├── utils.lua         # Utility functions
├── skkeleton.lua     # Skkeleton/denops communication with caching
└── completion.lua    # Completion item building
plugin/
└── blink-cmp-skkeleton.lua  # Auto-setup autocmds
```

### Source Methods

The plugin implements the blink.cmp source API:

- `enabled()`: Check if skkeleton is available
- `get_trigger_characters()`: Return Japanese trigger characters (hiragana + katakana)
- `get_completions()`: Fetch and build completion items with caching and context-aware filtering
- `resolve()`: Resolve additional information (no-op)
- `execute()`: Handle completion confirmation and dictionary learning

### Caching Strategy

- **Cache key**: `pre_edit` string (e.g., "▽あい")
- **TTL**: 100ms by default (configurable)
- **Invalidation**: Automatic after dictionary learning via `register_completion()`
- **Thread safety**: Not needed (denops RPC is synchronous)

<summary>📝 <strong>Implementation Notes</strong> (for developers)</summary>

### Character Count vs Byte Position

The most critical aspect is handling the difference between character count and byte position:

- `pre_edit_len` from skkeleton: **Character count** (e.g., 5 for "▽あいざわ")
- `context.cursor[2]`: **Byte position** (e.g., 15 bytes for UTF-8 "▽あいざわ")

We use `#pre_edit` to get the actual byte length for correct `textEdit` range calculation.

### Fuzzy Matching and Filtering

The plugin uses context-aware filtering to ensure compatibility with blink.cmp's keyword extraction:

- `filterText` is dynamically set based on `context.bounds` when available
- This ensures that blink.cmp's filtering matches the keyword it extracted
- For example, when typing after "相沢", blink.cmp may extract "相沢た" as the keyword
- The plugin sets `filterText='相沢た'` to match, preventing items from being filtered out
- When `context.bounds` is not available, falls back to using the kana reading

### Dictionary Learning

The plugin automatically detects the henkan type:

- Uppercase letters (e.g., "おくR") → okuriari
- Asterisk (e.g., "おく*り") → okuriari
- Otherwise → okurinasi

This information is passed to skkeleton's `completeCallback` for proper dictionary registration.

### Learning Without `accept`

`source:execute()` is reached only from blink.cmp's `accept` path, so `autoconfirm.lua` subscribes to the completion list instead.

The state that says "the user chose this" is only intact at the moment of selection, so that is where it is recorded — the reading, the dictionary entry, and where in the buffer the preview put the text. It cannot be read later: as soon as the user types on, `list.show()` calls `undo_preview()` and, because the keyword bounds moved, clears `is_explicitly_selected`.

| At select time | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `list.is_explicitly_selected` | `false` for the automatic preselect of the first entry, so opening the menu never records a choice. It also tells a deliberate deselect (stepping off the top of the list) from a preselect, which is why a preselect leaves an earlier choice pending instead of settling it |
| `list.preview_undo.cursor_after` | where the previewed text ends, so it can be recognised again later |

What decides it when the session ends is the buffer: the candidate is learned only if its text is still standing where the preview put it. That single check covers everything that must *not* be learned, because blink.cmp calls `undo_preview()` before it hides in every one of those cases:

- **`accept`** restores the pre-preview text and applies the real edit only later, after `resolve`, so nothing is standing when the hide arrives — and `source:execute()` learns it anyway
- **`cancel`** rolls the text back and leaves it that way
- **moving the selection** replaces the text with the next candidate's, so the one being left behind no longer stands

`blink.cmp.completion.list` is not a documented interface. Its emitters are used rather than the equivalent `BlinkCmpListSelect` / `BlinkCmpHide` autocmds because those are `vim.schedule`d, by which point the buffer and the state above have moved on. All of it is confined to `autoconfirm.lua`.

### Completion Backend Registration

`backend.register()` runs from `skkeleton-enable-pre`, the hook skkeleton documents for setting itself up. skkeleton only consults the backend while a completion menu is open, so registering there is early enough.

This does mean the plugin has to be loaded by then. If your plugin manager only loads it when blink.cmp first asks for its source, skkeleton reports `unknown completionBackend` and stays on `native`. Loading it together with blink.cmp — as in the installation example above — avoids that.
